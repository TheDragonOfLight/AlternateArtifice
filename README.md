# Alternate Artifice
This is A mod that I created as a little personal project, as I wanted to have the experience of making my own minecraft mod.  
## How to run:
- Compile the project into a .jar file | Alternatively, download the .jar file from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alternate-artifice).
- Install the .jar file into the latest version of minecraft forge 1.12.2.
- Run the forge version of minecraft.
