This is A mod that I created as a little personal project, as I wanted to have the experience of making my own minecraft mod.  
How to run:
- compile the project into a .jar file | alternatively, download the .jar file from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alternate-artifice)
- install the .jar file into the latest version of minecraft forge 1.12.2
- run the forge version of minecraft
